# Magic 8 Ball

So recently Julia was using a magic 8 ball a lot in a conversation to be funny, I said you should get a keychain but it seemed they didn't really make them tiny yet still functional.  
That spawned this idea, what if i get a magic 8 ball printed in acrylic with a QR code on the back side where basically I can scan the QR and get lead to a website that is very simple, just lets you input a question and outputs a response.  

## Final feature list
- Can shake mobile device to get response
- Can add responses to the magic 9 ball
- Can obviously ask it questions
